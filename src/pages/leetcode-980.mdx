Today's question was about finding the number of paths to reach the ending square in a grid. You can find more specifics about the question
in this [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-iii/description/).

For this question, I decided to use a backtracking search algorithm to solve the question. 

- Step 1: I wanted to identify the starting cell, the ending cell as well as the count of non-obstacle cells in the grid. I did a for-loop
that ran through the whole grid in a function ```locateStartingSquare```.

```javascript
    var locateStartingSquare = function(grid) {
        var start_coor = [0,0]
        var count = 0
        for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (let j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] === 1) start_coor = [i,j] // return upon finding 1
                if (grid[i][j] === 0) count += 1
                if (grid[i][j] == 2) end_coor = [i,j]
            }
        }
        return [start_coor, count, end_coor]
    }
```

I then implemented the backtracking algorithm starting with the x and y coordinates of the start point. After visiting a certain cell, I will mark the cell
as ```Infinity``` so as to indicate that the cell has been visited before. This ensures that every cell is only visited once at any point.
To check that all the non-obstacle cells have been visited, I maintain a count that will be incremented every time a cell is visited. 

The backtracking algorithm only returns if two conditions are met: 
1. We reach the ending point. 
2. The count we are maintaining matches the overall count of the number of non-obstacle cells in the grid.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
var uniquePathsIII = function(grid) {
    const dirs = [[-1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1]];
    var values = locateStartingSquare(grid) // locate the starting cell
    var startingSquare = values[0]
    var count = values[1] + 1
    var end = values[2]


    var results = 0

    function backtrack(x, y, p) {
        if (grid[x][y] === -1 || grid[x][y] === Infinity) return;

        if (x === end[0] && y === end[1] && p === count) {
            results++;
            return;
        }

        grid[x][y] = Infinity;
        for (const [di, dj] of dirs) {
            const i = x + di;
            const j = y + dj;
            if (i < 0 || i >= grid.length || j < 0 || j >= grid[0].length) continue;
            backtrack(i, j, p + 1);
        }
        grid[x][y] = 0;
    }

    backtrack(startingSquare[0], startingSquare[1], 0)
    return results
};
```
